The command line is a text-based tool where you can perform tasks by using certain words that perform different functions. You can use it do things you would normally do on a computer but without using a virtual interface where you'd move your mouse and click on things with.

Terminal commands:
1) pwd = shows you which directory/folder you are currently working in
2) cd = allows you to move to another directory/folder
3) rmdir = removes a directory/folder (but only if it's empty)
4) rm = removes files within that directory
5) rm -rf = removes directories with items in them
6) touch = allows you to create a file with any extension
7) cp = copy files followed by what you want to call the copy
8) cp -r = copy a directory with its contents
9) less = view a file
10) mkdir = creates a directory/folder
